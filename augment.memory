# Resume Website Project Memory

## UI Components and Styling
- Added shadcn Dialog and Switch components which created a components.json file in the project.
- Dialog components require a DialogTitle for accessibility, or it should be wrapped with a VisuallyHidden component.
- Fixed UI issues in resume website including timeline component styling, and color contrast improvements.
- Implemented a floating navbar from 21st.dev in the resume website, including animation effects.
- Fixed accessibility issues in resume website by adding DialogTitle to Sheet components and updating ConsentManager to use Dialog component from Radix UI.
- Installed shadcn timeline component from 21st.dev using `npx shadcn@latest add "https://21st.dev/r/nyxbui/timeline"`.

## Dark Mode
- Fixed dark mode in resume website by correcting darkMode configuration in tailwind.config.ts.
- The correct configuration is `darkMode: "class"` instead of `darkMode: ["class", "class"]`.
- Dark mode was broken after adding components.json file from shadcn components.

## Animations
- Added scroll animations to Experience section using framer-motion's whileInView feature.
- Timeline items animate in from the bottom with staggered delays.
- Content slides in from the right with a slight delay for a polished look.
- Used viewport detection with margin to start animations before elements are fully visible.

## Authentication and Database
- Fixed import and model name issues in user consent routes, changing from @/lib/db to @/lib/prisma and updating auth import from Clerk.

## Codebase Management
- User prefers a clean codebase and wants to remove unused files and components.
- User prefers using shadcn components from 21st.dev.
